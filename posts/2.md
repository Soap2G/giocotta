Website dev page: https://github.com/Soap2G/giocotta
Website deployment page: https://app.netlify.com/sites/giocotta/overview

Website is built on `React.js` and deploys over Netfly. Quite useful to be honest, just need the domain which is registered on Aruba.

Main URL: [giocotta.it](https://giocotta.it/)

**Current issues**: For some browsers the domain.it redirects correctly to https://domain.it whereas for others it opens a page from aruba saying that the domain is taken. No redirect.

**Tentative solution**: wait and att TXT record for giocotta.it in the DNS record in Aruba. Then use Google search Console to debug.
